  recommendations:
    - "Don't load all modules simultaneously, try to use aliases instead and run them when you need"
    - "Start with ml purge before loading new modules - alias setup_sci='ml purge && ml foss-2023b && ml OpenMPI/4.1.5'"
    - "Make and use aliases to load modules youneed to use to simplify workflow  - alias load_amber='ml purge && ml EasyBuild && ml Amber/2024-CUDA-11'"
